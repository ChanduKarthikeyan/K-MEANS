# K-MEANS
This project implements K-Means clustering on an FPGA to classify soil suitability for building construction. Using Python for preprocessing and Verilog HDL for FPGA logic, it ensures high-speed, energy-efficient, real-time processing. Tools used include MATLAB, Quartus Prime, and the DE1-SoC FPGA board.
